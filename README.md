# Industrial Copper Model

This project used decision treeregressor alogorithm to predict the status and price.This project has tow models noe to predict price and other one for status.

In data cleaning stage missing data identified and drop.In quantity ton field contain non numerical data.Before visualization it change to numeric data and na vlues ar dropped.




## Algorithm
